Functions and graphs usually include a small set of patterns.  
If you master these, you can pick up marks quickly.

## Core question types
1) **Reading values from a graph**  
2) **Plotting points accurately**  
3) **Understanding gradient and intercept**  
4) **Interpreting real‑life graphs**

## Fast improvement tips
**Tip 1: Use a clear scale.**  
If the scale is wrong, the whole question collapses.

**Tip 2: Plot points first, draw later.**  
Always mark points before drawing the line or curve.

**Tip 3: Check for reasonableness.**  
If a value is outside the graph, you misread the axis.

## Practice strategy
Do 5–8 short questions daily instead of one long worksheet.  
Consistency beats volume.
