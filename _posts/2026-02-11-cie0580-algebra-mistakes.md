Algebra questions in CIE 0580 are predictable — but small mistakes can cost full marks.  
Use this checklist to fix the most common errors before your next exam.

## 1) Sign errors when expanding brackets
**Fix:** Write one line for each term, then combine like terms.  
**Tip:** Double‑check negative signs by substituting a simple value (e.g., x = 1).

## 2) Factorising misses a common factor
**Fix:** Always take out the greatest common factor first.  
Example: `6x^2 + 9x = 3x(2x + 3)`.

## 3) Solving linear equations too early
**Fix:** Simplify both sides before moving terms.  
This reduces errors when you have fractions or brackets.

## 4) Mixing up “equation” and “expression”
**Fix:** Only solve when there is an equals sign.  
Otherwise, you simplify or factorise.

## 5) Incorrect substitution into formulas
**Fix:** Replace variables with brackets before you calculate.  
Example: `y = 2x + 3` with `x = -4` → `y = 2(-4) + 3`.

## 6) Cancelling terms incorrectly
**Fix:** You can cancel factors, not terms.  
Example: `x + 2` cannot cancel with `x`.

## 7) Ignoring domain restrictions
**Fix:** Check if the question asks for valid values or restrictions.
