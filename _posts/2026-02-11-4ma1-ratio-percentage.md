Ratio and percentage questions look easy — but they hide common traps.  
Use this checklist to protect your marks.

## Mistake 1: Not simplifying the ratio first
Always simplify before you calculate.  
Example: 12:18 → 2:3.

## Mistake 2: Mixing ratio and fraction language
If a part is “2 of 5,” that is **2/5 of the total**.  
Make the fraction explicit before calculating.

## Mistake 3: Percentage of a percentage
When a value changes by a percent, apply the change to the **current value**, not the original.

## Mistake 4: Reverse percentage problems
If something is “after” a change, you need to divide by the multiplier.  
Example: 80% of original → divide by 0.8.
