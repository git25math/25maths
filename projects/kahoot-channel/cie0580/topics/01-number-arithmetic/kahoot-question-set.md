# CIE 0580 - 01 Number Arithmetic (Kahoot Question Set)

## 1. Syllabus Knowledge Split (Exam-Oriented)
- Number operations and order of operations (BIDMAS).
- Integers, negative number operations.
- Factors, multiples, HCF and LCM in context.
- Standard form conversions and powers of 10.
- Estimation and rounding for calculator/non-calculator checks.

## 2. Past-Paper Question Type Mapping
- Type A: Single-step numeric calculation under time pressure.
- Type B: HCF/LCM word context (grouping/scheduling cycles).
- Type C: Standard form conversion both directions.
- Type D: Estimation check to validate exact answer reasonableness.
- Type E: Common-trap operation order with indices and brackets.
