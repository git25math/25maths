## Question Set (MCQ)
| # | Question | A | B | C | D | Correct | Quick rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Evaluate \(18 - 5 \times 2\). | 26 | 13 | 8 | 16 | C | Multiply first: 5×2=10, then 18-10=8. |
| 2 | Evaluate \(3^2 + 4\). | 13 | 25 | 7 | 12 | A | 3^2=9, then 9+4=13. |
| 3 | Which is a prime number? | 21 | 27 | 29 | 39 | C | 29 has only 1 and 29 as factors. |
| 4 | What is the place value of 7 in 4.73? | 7 ones | 7 tenths | 7 hundredths | 7 thousandths | B | 4.73 means 7 tenths and 3 hundredths. |
| 5 | Evaluate \((16 \div 4) \times (3+2)\). | 20 | 10 | 8 | 4 | A | 16÷4=4 and (3+2)=5, so 4×5=20. |
| 6 | Evaluate \(24 \div (3 \times 2)\). | 16 | 12 | 6 | 4 | D | Brackets first: 3×2=6, then 24÷6=4. |
| 7 | Find HCF of 18 and 30. | 2 | 3 | 6 | 9 | C | Common factors are 1,2,3,6; highest is 6. |
| 8 | Find LCM of 6 and 8. | 24 | 12 | 48 | 18 | A | Smallest common multiple is 24. |
| 9 | Write 0.00045 in standard form. | 4.5×10^-5 | 4.5×10^-4 | 45×10^-5 | 0.45×10^-3 | B | Move decimal 4 places right -> 4.5×10^-4. |
|10 | Write 3.2×10^3 as an ordinary number. | 320 | 3200 | 32 000 | 3 200 000 | B | 10^3 shifts decimal 3 places right. |
|11 | Round 7.846 to 2 decimal places. | 7.84 | 7.85 | 7.80 | 7.9 | B | Third decimal is 6, so round up. |
|12 | Evaluate \(-4 + 9\). | -13 | -5 | 5 | 13 | C | -4 + 9 = 5. |
|13 | Evaluate \(15 - (-7)\). | 8 | -8 | 22 | -22 | C | Subtracting a negative means add. |
|14 | Which estimate is closest to \(19.8 \times 5.1\)? | 50 | 80 | 100 | 150 | C | 20×5≈100. |
|15 | A number is divisible by 3 and 5. Which could it be? | 45 | 52 | 68 | 77 | A | 45 divisible by both 3 and 5. |
|16 | Evaluate \(2 + 3 \times 4^2\). | 196 | 50 | 34 | 80 | B | 4^2=16, 3×16=48, then +2=50. |
|17 | If \(n=5\), find \(3n^2 - 2n\). | 65 | 75 | 55 | 45 | A | 3(25)-10=75-10=65. |
|18 | Find LCM of 9 and 12. | 18 | 24 | 36 | 72 | C | Multiples meet first at 36. |
