# CIE 0580 Worksheet (Student)
## Topic: Number Arithmetic (BIDMAS, HCF/LCM, Standard Form)

Name: ____________________   Date: ____________________

## 1. What the syllabus expects
- Use order of operations accurately.
- Work with factors, multiples, HCF, and LCM.
- Convert numbers to and from standard form.
- Estimate and check whether answers are reasonable.

## 2. Common exam question styles
- Direct calculation with mixed operations and powers.
- Worded HCF/LCM context problems.
- Standard form conversions in either direction.
- Estimation before or after exact calculation.

## 3. Model example (worked)
Evaluate `20 - 3 x 4 + 2^3`.
- Step 1: Powers first: `2^3 = 8`.
- Step 2: Multiplication: `3 x 4 = 12`.
- Step 3: Left to right for + and -: `20 - 12 + 8 = 8 + 8 = 16`.
Final answer: `16`.

## 4. Practice (10 questions)
1. Evaluate `14 - 3 x 2`.
2. Evaluate `(18 / 3) x (5 - 2)`.
3. Find the HCF of 24 and 36.
4. Find the LCM of 8 and 12.
5. Write `0.0032` in standard form.
6. Write `7.5 x 10^2` as an ordinary number.
7. Round 12.467 to 2 decimal places.
8. Evaluate `20 - (-4)`.
9. Estimate `49.8 / 10.1`.
10. Two buses leave a station every 15 minutes and every 20 minutes. They leave together at 09:00. At what time will they next leave together?
